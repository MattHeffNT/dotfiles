### Heff's Dotfiles

Now managed through Chezmoi[https://www.chezmoi.io/].

As the name suggests, it's where I keep my precious dotfiles and can sync them across devices/VMs etc. 

I do eventually probably need to add some logic to my zshrc to ensure that it can differentiate between Mac and Linux though.

The Chezmoi userguide is also extensive and there are ways in which you can set up your dotfiles to install the things as well. But, I'm currently still a n00b so that's a work in progress.

Anyway, I'm excited to try this for now.
